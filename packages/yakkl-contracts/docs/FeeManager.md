## FeeManager.sol:
Explanation of the FeeManager Contract:
Fee Calculation (calculateFee):

This function calculates the fee based on the provided amount and feeBasisPoints.
Ensures that the feeBasisPoints do not exceed FEE_PRECISION to prevent unintentional high fees.
Calculate and Distribute Fee (calculateAndDistributeFee):

This function calculates the fee, checks if sufficient Ether is sent to cover it, and then transfers the fee to the feeRecipient.
If the fee transfer fails, the transaction reverts, ensuring atomicity.
Rescue Function (rescueETH):

The owner can rescue any Ether accidentally sent to the contract, which is useful for reclaiming funds sent to the contract without an intended purpose.
Fee Recipient Management (setFeeRecipient):

The owner can update the fee recipient address, allowing for flexibility in fee management.

Calculate Fee with Maximum Basis Points:

Tests fee calculation at the maximum possible fee basis points (100%, or 1,000,000 basis points).
Calculate Fee with Zero Basis Points:

Tests fee calculation with 0% fee, ensuring no fee is charged.
Calculate and Distribute Fee with Maximum Basis Points:

Tests the calculation and distribution of fees at the maximum possible fee (100%).

## Summary:
