Automatic Renewal. To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically\n\t\trenewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable\n\t\tsubscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to use any payment\n\t\tmechanism we have on record for you, like credit cards or PayPal, or crypto to collect the\n\t\tthen-applicable subscription fee as well as any Taxes. By default, your Paid Services will be\n\t\trenewed for the same interval as your original subscription period, so for example, if you\n\t\tpurchase a one-year subscription for an advanced security plan, you&#39;ll be charged each year\n\t\tfor access for another 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the\n\t\tend of the subscription period to make sure pesky billing issues don&#39;t inadvertently disrupt\n\t\tyour access to our Services. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the\n\t\toriginal purchase and cannot be changed. If you&#39;ve purchased access to multiple services,\n\t\tyou may have multiple renewal dates.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="mt-2">\n\t\tTo review renewal dates and manage subscriptions for any other Paid Services, please consult the\n\t\trespective Service&#39;s website portal or contact the support team.

Cancelling Automatic Renewal. You can manage and cancel any Paid Services at the respective\n\t\tService&#39;s website portal.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="mt-2">\n\t\tIf auto-renew is successfully turned off, you&#39;ll see the date on which your subscription\n\t\texpires. If you have multiple Paid Services to cancel, repeat this process for each\n\t\tsubscription.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="mt-2">\n\t\tf. Fees and Changes. We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these Terms and\n\t\trequirements under applicable law. This means that we may change our fees going forward, start\n\t\tcharging fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update features or\n\t\tfunctionality that were previously included in the fees. If you don&#39;t agree with the\n\t\tchanges, you must cancel your Paid Service.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="mt-2">\n\t\tg. No-Show Policy. We may have a “no-show policy” for some Paid Services that require your\n\t\tparticipation. For instance, this may mean that if you don&#39;t show up or are late for a\n\t\tscheduled session or training, you&#39;ll still be charged and won&#39;t be entitled to a\n\t\trefund.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="mt-2">\n\t\th.
