// src/hooks.client.v1.ts - This is a copy of the original hooks.client.ts for v1
// When building v1, this file is copied to hooks.client.ts by build-config.js

// This file should contain the original hooks.client.ts logic without preview2 modifications
// For now, this is a placeholder. In production, you would copy the existing hooks.client.ts here

// The content would be identical to the current hooks.client.ts
// but preserved for v1 builds
