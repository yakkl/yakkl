## 🔐 Step 2: Account Creation

### 📝 Choose Your Identity
1. **Username Selection**:
   - Pick something memorable but not too personal
   - Avoid using real names for privacy
   - Examples: "CryptoLearner2024", "Portfolio123"
   - 🎯 **Tip**: You can change this later in settings

2. **Email Address**:
   - Use a secure email you regularly check
   - This is for account recovery and important notifications
   - Consider using a dedicated email for crypto activities
   - 🔒 **Privacy**: YAKKL never sells or shares your email

3. **Password Creation**:
   - **Minimum 12 characters** - longer is better
   - **Mix of letters, numbers, symbols**
   - **Avoid personal information** (birthdays, names)
   - **Use a password manager** if possible
   - 🎯 **Example**: "Crypto2024!MyFirstWallet"

### 🛡️ Security Setup
1. **Two-Factor Authentication (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Choose SMS or authenticator app
   - Authenticator apps are more secure (Google Authenticator, Authy)
   - Write down backup codes in a safe place

2. **Security Questions**:
   - Choose questions with memorable but not obvious answers
   - Avoid answers easily found on social media
   - Consider using a password manager for these too

## 🔑 Step 3: Wallet Generation

### 🎲 Creating Your Wallet
**Your wallet is automatically generated using advanced cryptography:**

1. **Entropy Generation**:
   - YAKKL uses your device's random number generator
   - Additional entropy from mouse movements and keystrokes
   - Ensures your wallet is truly unique and secure

2. **Key Derivation**:
   - Private key generated from secure randomness
   - Public key derived from private key
   - Wallet address created from public key

3. **Multi-Network Support**:
   - Same wallet works across all supported networks
   - Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and more
   - Separate addresses for each network but same recovery phrase

### 🔒 Understanding Your Keys
**Important concepts to understand:**

**Private Key**:
- ✅ Controls your crypto (whoever has this owns your funds)
- ✅ Never share or store digitally
- ✅ YAKKL never sees or stores your private key
- ✅ Stays encrypted on your device

**Public Key**:
- ✅ Safe to share (used to receive crypto)
- ✅ Creates your wallet address
- ✅ Cannot be used to spend your crypto

**Recovery Phrase**:
- ✅ 12-24 words that can restore your wallet
- ✅ Backup for all your private keys
- ✅ Most important thing to keep safe

## 📝 Step 4: Securing Your Recovery Phrase

### 🚨 Critical Security Warning
**Your recovery phrase is the master key to your crypto. Losing it means losing access to your funds forever. This is the most important step!**

### ✍️ Writing Down Your Phrase
1. **Get Physical Materials**:
   - Pen (not pencil - it can fade)
   - Paper or special recovery phrase template
   - Consider metal backup plates for long-term storage

2. **Write Carefully**:
   - Print clearly in block letters
   - Double-check each word
   - Verify spelling against the provided word list
   - Include word numbers (1, 2, 3...)

3. **Verification Process**:
   - YAKKL will ask you to verify specific words
   - This ensures you wrote everything correctly
   - Don't skip this step - it's crucial!

### 🔒 Storage Best Practices
**Where to store your recovery phrase:**

**✅ Good Options:**
- Fireproof safe at home
- Bank safety deposit box
- Laminated paper in secure location
- Metal backup plates (for fire protection)

**❌ Bad Options:**
- Photos on your phone
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud)
- Email drafts
- Password managers (for the phrase itself)
- Anywhere digital or online

**🎯 Pro Tips:**
- Make multiple copies
- Store in different geographic locations
- Consider a backup with trusted family (sealed envelope)
- Never enter your phrase on any website except YAKKL recovery

## ⚙️ Step 5: Basic Security Configuration

### 🔐 Auto-Lock Settings
**Protect your wallet when you're away:**
1. **Set auto-lock timer** - Recommended: 15 minutes
2. **Choose lock method**:
   - Password
   - PIN (faster but less secure)
   - Biometric (if available)
3. **Test the lock** - Make sure it works as expected

### 🔔 Notification Preferences
**Stay informed about your account:**
- **Transaction confirmations** - Know when crypto moves
- **Security alerts** - Important account changes
- **Price alerts** - Track your favorite cryptocurrencies
- **News updates** - Stay informed about crypto markets

### 🌐 Network Selection
**Choose your starting network:**
- **Ethereum** - Most popular, largest ecosystem
- **Polygon** - Faster and cheaper transactions
- **Arbitrum** - Layer 2 scaling solution
- **Base** - Coinbase's network
- 🎯 **Tip**: You can switch networks anytime

## 💰 Step 6: Your First Crypto

### 📥 Receiving Your First Crypto
**Ready to add crypto to your wallet?**

**Method 1: Buy with Credit/Debit Card**
1. **Click "Buy Crypto"** in your wallet
2. **Choose amount** - Start small ($20-50)
3. **Select cryptocurrency** - Bitcoin or Ethereum recommended
4. **Complete purchase** - Follow payment provider steps
5. **Wait for confirmation** - Usually 5-15 minutes

**Method 2: Receive from Another Wallet**
1. **Find "Receive" button** in your wallet
2. **Copy your wallet address** - Long string starting with 0x
3. **Share with sender** - They need this to send crypto
4. **Or show QR code** - For easy mobile scanning
5. **Wait for transaction** - Usually confirmed in minutes

### 🔍 Understanding Your Address
**Your wallet address is like your bank account number:**
- ✅ Safe to share publicly
- ✅ Used to receive crypto
- ✅ Different address for each network
- ✅ Always starts with 0x (for Ethereum-based networks)

**Example address**: `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`

### 💡 Address Safety Tips
- **Double-check addresses** - One wrong character loses your crypto
- **Use copy/paste** - Don't type addresses manually
- **Verify with QR codes** - Reduces human error
- **Start with small amounts** - Test with $10-20 first

## 🔄 Step 7: Your First Transaction

### 📤 Sending Crypto
**Ready to send your first transaction?**

1. **Click "Send"** in your wallet
2. **Choose the crypto** you want to send
3. **Enter recipient address** - Copy/paste carefully
4. **Enter amount** - Start small for your first test
5. **Review transaction details**:
   - Recipient address
   - Amount being sent
   - Network fee (gas)
   - Total cost
6. **Confirm transaction** - Click "Send"
7. **Wait for confirmation** - Usually 1-5 minutes

### ⛽ Understanding Gas Fees
**Every transaction requires a network fee:**
- **What it pays for**: Network processing and security
- **How much**: Varies by network congestion
- **When you pay**: Deducted from your wallet balance
- **Can't be refunded**: Even if transaction fails

**Typical gas fees:**
- **Ethereum**: $5-50 (varies widely)
- **Polygon**: $0.01-0.10
- **Arbitrum**: $0.50-5.00
- **Base**: $0.10-1.00

### 📊 Transaction Status
**Understanding what happens after you send:**

1. **Pending** - Transaction submitted to network
2. **Confirming** - Network is processing (1-3 confirmations)
3. **Confirmed** - Transaction completed successfully
4. **Failed** - Transaction failed (you keep your crypto, lose gas fee)
