   - Contact integration in send flow
   - Real swap integration (Uniswap/Sushiswap)

3. **Token Management**
   - Add custom token
   - Multiple view options

4. **Account Features**
   - Hardware wallet support
   - Watch-only accounts
   - Multiple account types

### Medium Priority

   - Enhanced request handling

2. **Settings**
   - Custom network addition
   - Language/currency selection

3. **UI/UX Features**
   - Multiple token view options
   - Advanced search/filter
   - Token charts and technical analysis

## New Features in V2

- Improved session management
- Modern UI with shadcn components

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Implement import/export functionality for security
   - Add gas management to transaction flows
   - Complete swap integration with DEXs

2. **Short-term Goals**:
   - Add hardware wallet support
   - Implement contact management
   - Add custom token functionality

3. **Long-term Enhancements**:
   - Restore multiple view options
   - Add advanced analytics

## Technical Debt

Many v1 components exist in the codebase but are not integrated into v2:
- Components are in `/lib/components/v1/`
- Services and managers are available
- Routes exist but have basic implementations

The architecture supports these features; they need to be:
1. Migrated from v1 component structure
2. Updated to use v2 stores and patterns
3. Integrated into existing routes
4. Styled with the new design system
