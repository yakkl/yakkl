# Fixes for "Attempting to use a disconnected port object" Error

## Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes applied to resolve the "Attempting to use a disconnected port object" error that occurs when trying to send messages through disconnected browser extension ports.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Port Connection Checks**: Many `port.postMessage()` calls lacked validation to ensure the port was still connected
2. **Race Conditions During Cleanup**: Complex port cleanup logic had race conditions where messages were sent after disconnection started
3. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Most postMessage calls weren't wrapped in try-catch blocks to handle disconnection errors gracefully
4. **Lack of Retry Logic**: No mechanism to retry failed messages due to port disconnection

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Safe Port Messaging Utility (`/lib/common/safePortMessaging.ts`)

This new utility provides:
- **Port Connection Tracking**: Monitors port states and connection status
- **Safe Message Sending**: `safePortPostMessage()` function that checks port status before sending
- **Error Detection**: Uses `isChannelClosedError()` to identify disconnection-related errors
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry mechanism for failed messages
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Periodic cleanup of disconnected port states

Key features:
```typescript
// Safe port messaging with error handling
safePortPostMessage(port, message, {
  context: 'description',
  retries: 3,
  onError: (error) => { /* handle error */ }
});

// Port wrapper class for consistent usage
const safePort = new SafePortWrapper(port, 'context-name');
await safePort.postMessage(message);

// Broadcast to multiple ports safely
safeBroadcastToports(ports, message, { continueOnError: true });
```

### 2. Enhanced Message Channel Error Detection (`/lib/common/messageChannelWrapper.ts`)

Updated the `isChannelClosedError()` function to detect:
- `"Attempting to use a disconnected port"`
- `"message channel closed"`
- `"message port closed"`
- `"Extension context invalidated"`

### 3. Fixed Critical Files

#### A. Background Browser API Port Handler (`/contexts/background/handlers/browser-api-port.handler.ts`)
- Replaced all `port.postMessage()` calls with `safePortPostMessage()`
- Added proper error handling for both success and error responses
- Provides context-specific error logging

#### B. Browser API Port Service (`/lib/services/browser-api-port.service.ts`)
- Enhanced error detection in `sendPortRequest()` method
- Improved retry logic specifically for disconnected port errors
- Better logging and error context

#### C. Main Background Script (`/contexts/background/extensions/chrome/background.ts`)
- Fixed 7+ critical `postMessage()` calls throughout the file
- Added safe messaging for:
  - Dapp request error responses
  - Message processing errors
  - Response forwarding to original requesters
  - Approval resolve/reject responses
  - Popup result responses
  - Direct result responses
  - Event broadcasting

#### D. EIP-6963 Handler (`/contexts/background/extensions/chrome/eip-6963.ts`)
- Replaced `postMessage()` calls in success/error response handling
- Fixed event broadcasting function `broadcastToEIP6963Ports()`
- Added comprehensive error logging

## Key Improvements

### 1. Graceful Error Handling
All port messages now fail gracefully with proper logging instead of throwing uncaught exceptions.

### 2. Context-Aware Logging
Each safe port message includes context information to help identify the source of any issues:
```typescript
context: 'background-approval-resolve'
context: 'eip6963-success'
context: 'browser-api-port-error'
```

### 3. Automatic Port State Management
The system now automatically:
- Tracks port connection states
- Cleans up disconnected ports
- Prevents messages to known disconnected ports
- Provides connection status checks

### 4. Retry Mechanisms
Failed messages can be automatically retried with configurable:
- Number of retries
- Retry delays
- Context-specific retry logic

### 5. Comprehensive Coverage
Fixed all major areas where port disconnection errors occurred:
- Background script message handling
- Browser API port communications
- EIP-6963 provider interactions
- Event broadcasting systems
- Error response handling

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Test Port Disconnection**: Manually disconnect ports during message sending
2. **Test Extension Reload**: Reload the extension while messages are in flight
3. **Test Network Issues**: Simulate network interruptions during port communication
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check that safe port messaging logs appear instead of uncaught exceptions
5. **Test Retry Logic**: Verify messages retry appropriately when ports reconnect

## Files Modified

1. `/lib/common/safePortMessaging.ts` - **NEW** - Core safe messaging utility
2. `/contexts/background/handlers/browser-api-port.handler.ts` - Fixed postMessage calls
3. `/lib/services/browser-api-port.service.ts` - Enhanced error handling
4. `/contexts/background/extensions/chrome/background.ts` - Fixed 7+ postMessage calls
5. `/contexts/background/extensions/chrome/eip-6963.ts` - Fixed response and broadcast calls
6. `/lib/common/messageChannelWrapper.ts` - Enhanced error detection (already existed)

## Result

These fixes should completely eliminate the "Attempting to use a disconnected port object" error by:
- Preventing messages to disconnected ports
- Gracefully handling port disconnection during message sending
- Providing comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Implementing automatic retry mechanisms
- Maintaining proper port state tracking

The error will now be handled gracefully with appropriate logging instead of causing uncaught exceptions that could crash or destabilize the extension.
