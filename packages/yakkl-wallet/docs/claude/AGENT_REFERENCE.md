## Parallel Execution Patterns

### Recommended Parallel Combinations

**For New Features:**
```
parallel: [project-architect, security-auditor, test-runner]
```

**For Performance Issues:**
```
parallel: [performance-optimizer, test-runner]
```

**For Security Updates:**
```
parallel: [security-auditor, checkpoint-manager, test-runner]
```

**For Documentation:**
```
parallel: [documentation-updater, workflow-optimizer]
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Automatic Invocation
Agents marked with **AUTOMATIC** or **PROACTIVE** will be triggered automatically when:
1. The task matches their specialization
2. The context requires their expertise
3. Risk mitigation is needed

### Manual Invocation
You can explicitly request agents:
- "Use the performance-optimizer to analyze bundle size"
- "Run security-auditor and test-runner in parallel"
- "Create a checkpoint before proceeding"

### Best Practices
1. **Let automation work** - Trust automatic agent invocation
2. **Be specific when needed** - Request specific agents for targeted analysis
3. **Use parallel execution** - Multiple agents can run simultaneously
4. **Critical path first** - project-architect â†’ implementation â†’ test-runner
5. **Safety first** - checkpoint-manager before risky operations

## Agent Communication
- Agents are stateless - each invocation is independent
- Provide detailed context in your request
- Agents return a final report that I'll summarize for you
- Results guide subsequent actions but aren't visible to you directly
