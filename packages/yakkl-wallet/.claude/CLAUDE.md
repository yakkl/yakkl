# CLAUDE.md

This file provides current status and recent updates for Claude Code when working with the YAKKL Smart Wallet project. For detailed architecture and development rules, see `.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

## Quick Reference

### üöÄ Current Sprint Focus
- **Version**: v2.0.1
- **Last Review**: 2025-08-05
- **Primary Goal**: Production-ready with enterprise-grade security

### üìÅ Key Documentation
- **Architecture & Rules**: `.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- **Workflow Guide**: `.claude/WORKFLOW.md`
- **Agent Descriptions**: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- **Commands**: `.claude/slash_commands/*.md`

### üõ†Ô∏è Essential Commands

- Run the pnpm commands from /yakkl-wallet project directory

```bash
# Development
pnpm run dev:chrome     # Run the pnpm commands from /yakkl root directory
# pnpm test:wallet        # Run wallet tests
# pnpm run check:wallet   # Type checking
# pnpm run lint:wallet    # Linting

# Documentation
/doc-updater            # Update all docs
/changelog              # Generate changelog
/checkpoint create      # Create safety checkpoint

# Context & Help
/context                # Show relevant context
/rules                  # Quick rule reference
```

### Rework prompt given IMPORTANT
- Rework the prompt given if the prompt:
  - Does not provide you with enough detail
  - Does not make sense
  - Contains sensitive information (usually done by mistake)
  - If you feel it could be better for you to create, enhance, or fix all code involved with the prompt

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE
1. **NO DYNAMIC IMPORTS** - Use static imports only. Dynamic imports (`await import()`) break webpack in service worker contexts.
   - Exceptions (use ONLY when absolutely necessary):
     - `webextension-polyfill` in client context with browser environment check
     - Circular dependency resolution (must be documented with comment)
     - Provider/blockchain abstraction where different implementations are loaded conditionally
     - Network providers (Alchemy, Infura, etc.) loaded based on configuration
   - All other imports MUST be static at the top of the file
   - If using dynamic import for valid reason, MUST add comment explaining why
2. **Never modify webextension-polyfill import handling** - It has special handling for browser/non-browser contexts
3. **NO BIG NUMBER DISPLAY ERRORS** - Always use proper BigNumber formatting utilities
   - Use `formatBigNumberForDisplay()` for UI values
   - Never display raw BigNumber objects
   - Implement responsive font sizing for large values
   - Test with extreme values (very large and very small numbers)

## Current Status (Last Updated: 2025-08-05)

### Do not touch the following - it may have been done manually
- SimpleTooltip.svelte - I have fixed it and it looks great. Please do not touch
- `export const pre-render = <whatever I have already>`
- `export const ssr = <whatever I have already>  OR if I don't have it then don't create one`

### üêõ Known Issues & TODOs

### üîß Active Configuration

#### Feature Flags

#### Plan Types
- `explorer_member` - Basic with Secure Recovery
- `yakkl_pro` - Advanced features
- `early_adopter` - Pro + perks
- `founding_member` - Pro + perks
- `enterprise` - Business features

## Development Workflow
### Starting a New Task
1. Use project-architect for analysis: `Use the project-architect agent to analyze...`
2. Follow recommended agent sequence
3. Create checkpoints before major changes
4. After completing all code then run `pnpm run dev:chrome` if running in the yakkl-wallet project. Fix all warnings and errors - continue this until all warning and errors are gone
5. Update documentation after completion

### Quick Agent Reference
- **project-architect**: Start here for any task
- **wallet-component-builder**: UI components
- **blockchain-integration**: Web3/contracts
- **store-manager**: State management
- **security-auditor**: Security review
- **test-runner**: Testing
- **performance-optimizer**: Optimization
- **v2-migration**: v1‚Üív2 features

### Finished your task and ready to return control back to a human
- ALWAYS run `pnpm run dev:chrome` from the /yakkl-wallet project directory of the mono-repo
- Fix any error or warnings until they are all completed and everything compiles cleaning (repeat if needed)

## Recent Architecture Improvements

### üèóÔ∏è Major Updates (2025-08-05)


#### Portfolio Rollup System
- Multi-level aggregation (account, chain, grand total)
- Synchronized portfolio and transaction views
- Real-time updates with intelligent caching
- Architecture doc: `.claude/PORTFOLIO_ROLLUP_ARCHITECTURE.md`

#### Security Enhancements
- JWT token invalidation during wallet lock
- Secure token blacklisting with SHA-256 hashing
- Enhanced popup security management
- Files: `jwt-background.ts`, lock management utilities

#### Service Worker Compatibility
- Static imports only (no dynamic imports)
- Message channel error prevention
- Payload validation for all handlers
- Fixed async response errors in browser API

## Recent File Changes

### Browser API Refactoring (2025-07-29)
- **Critical Plan**: `.claude/BROWSER_API_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`
- Proof of concept complete for message-passing architecture
- Test page: `/routes/(wallet)/test-browser-api/+page.svelte`
- Solves SSR conflicts with browser extension APIs

### Key Modified Files (Last Update)
- `/lib/services/base.service.ts` - Real messaging
- `/lib/stores/token.store.ts` - Multi-chain support
- `/lib/components/TokenPortfolio.svelte` - Price formatting
- `/lib/components/pro/AdvancedAnalytics.svelte` - Charts

- `/lib/utilities/jwt-background.ts` - Token invalidation (NEW)
- `/lib/services/portfolio-rollup.service.ts` - Portfolio aggregation (NEW)

### Development Notes
- Dropped error logging checks for items 3 and 6 per discussion
- Planning to use Sentry for error logs later
- Browser extension checks deemed unnecessary
- Considering a dialog popup when FAB is clicked
- Ensuring `.claude/agents` and hooks are functioning correctly
- Maintaining consistent git checkpoints during development

## Privacy Note
The YAKKL project includes both public and private repositories. When working in public repositories, do not expose internal details of private packages.
