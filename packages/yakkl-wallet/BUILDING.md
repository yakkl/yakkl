# YAKKL’s “Build in the Open” Philosophy

**Transparency breeds trust. Innovation earns it. Protection keeps it.**

At YAKKL, we believe in building the future of crypto security with our community—not just for them. That’s why we commit to building in the open wherever it strengthens user trust, safety, and collaboration.

This document outlines the core values, strategies, and technical boundaries that guide our “build in the open” philosophy. It evolves with us. And we invite you to grow with it.

## What We Open Source — and Why

We open source what we believe must be inspectable for user safety, developer contribution, and the broader mission of open crypto infrastructure. This includes:

- Core Wallet Code – All base-level functionality: transaction signing, account creation, and wallet operations.
- Smart Contracts – Wherever applicable, smart contracts are verifiable and auditable by the public.
- Public SDKs & APIs – Developers can extend and integrate with YAKKL without guessing at the internals.
- Documentation & Educational Tools – We believe in empowering users and developers through knowledge.

Our GitHub is a living library of what we’re learning and improving.

## What We Keep Closed — and Why

Security is not just transparency—it’s strategy. Certain systems and features are closed source to prevent exploitation, protect intellectual property, and maintain the security of all users.

We keep private:

- Advanced Key Management Infrastructure
- AI-Powered Threat Detection & Risk Scoring
- Proprietary Security Layers such as phishing detection, behavioral anomaly engines, and anti-fraud triggers
- Emergency Kit (More Below)
- Pro-Tier Analytics & Recovery Systems

These tools give YAKKL a crucial edge in protecting users, and exposing them would only help attackers.

## Feature Spotlight: The Emergency Kit

One of our proudest innovations is the YAKKL Emergency Kit.

_"When things go wrong, YAKKL helps you go back in time—securely."_

The Emergency Kit isn’t just a recovery phrase. It’s a full-spectrum encrypted backup of your wallet experience:

- Private keys & secrets
- User settings & bookmarks
- Wallet configuration
- Multi-layer encryption, safe for device/cloud storage
- One-click browser-based restoration

In the event your browser wallet is removed, corrupted, or lost, simply reinstall and select **Restore from Emergency Kit**. You’ll be back in business—with everything just how you left it.

This is closed source due to its sensitivity and layered encryption system. But we publicly document the principles that guide its design, and we submit it to third-party audits regularly.

## Our Public Commitments

- Transparent Roadmap – We publish a quarterly roadmap with both public and PRO-tier goals.
- Security Audits – We work with trusted firms to audit critical systems and share results where applicable.
- Open Feedback Loop – Our Discord, GitHub, and support channels are always open for ideas, questions, and issues.
- Education-First – We publish regular articles on crypto security, wallet technology, and user empowerment.

## Why We Build This Way

Because this space has too many black boxes, hype launches, and rugs.

YAKKL exists to:

- Restore user confidence in crypto tools
- Make advanced security accessible
- And do it in a way that invites participation, not just consumption

Whether you’re a user, contributor, investor, or critic—we want you to understand how we think, how we work, and where we’re headed.
