# Performance Optimization: Duplicate Price API Calls Fixed

## Problem Identified
The YAKKL Smart Wallet was making **6 duplicate API calls** for the same ETH/USD price because:

1. **Multiple Price Services**: Two price services were running simultaneously:
   - Legacy `background-price.service.ts` (deprecated)
   - New `BackgroundPriceService.ts` (service worker compatible)

2. **No Request Deduplication**: Multiple components requesting the same price pair would trigger separate API calls

3. **Poor Cache Coordination**: Cache wasn't being checked consistently across services

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Request Deduplication System
- Added `pendingRequests` Map to track in-flight price requests
- Prevents multiple simultaneous requests for the same price pair
- Shares results of pending requests across callers

### 2. Enhanced Caching Strategy
- 60-second TTL cache for price data
- Cache-first approach with proper fallback
- Consistent cache checking across all price fetching methods

### 3. Batch Price Processing
- Collects all unique price pairs needed across tokens
- Fetches prices in optimized batches with rate limiting
- Reduces API calls from N tokens to unique pairs only

### 4. Service Consolidation
- Deprecated legacy `background-price.service.ts`
- Consolidated all price fetching through `BackgroundPriceService.ts`
- Service worker compatible with proper error handling

## Performance Improvements

### Before:
- 6+ duplicate ETH/USD calls per update cycle
- Individual API calls for each token
- No coordination between services
- Cache bypassing due to race conditions

### After:
- 1 API call per unique price pair
- Shared results across all consumers
- Proper cache utilization (60s TTL)
- Batch processing with rate limiting

## Files Modified

### Core Changes:
- `src/lib/services/background/BackgroundPriceService.ts`
  - Added request deduplication
  - Enhanced caching mechanism
  - Batch price processing

- `src/lib/services/background/providers/BackgroundPriceManager.ts`
  - Improved batch fetching with rate limiting
  - Better error handling and logging

- `src/lib/services/background-interval.service.ts`
  - Uses consolidated price service
  - Removed duplicate service calls

### Deprecated:
- `src/lib/services/background-price.service.ts`
  - Marked as deprecated to prevent future use

## Expected Results

1. **API Call Reduction**: ~80% reduction in duplicate price API calls
2. **Faster Response Times**: Cached results served immediately
3. **Better Rate Limit Compliance**: Batch processing with delays
4. **Improved Reliability**: Shared error handling and fallbacks

## Monitoring

The services now log:
- Cache hits vs API calls
- Batch processing efficiency
- Request deduplication statistics
- Rate limiting compliance

Look for logs like:
```
[BackgroundPriceService] Using cached price for ETH/USD: 2626.69
[BackgroundPriceService] Batch fetching 3 unique pairs (6 total requested)
[BackgroundPriceManager] Batch fetch completed: 3 prices fetched
```

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Filter for "coingecko" or "coinbase" API calls
3. Refresh the wallet or trigger a price update
4. Should see significantly fewer duplicate requests

The optimization maintains the same functionality while dramatically reducing API calls and improving performance.
