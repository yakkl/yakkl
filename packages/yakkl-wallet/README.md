> 🔐 Note: This project includes placeholders for private UI components. These are mocked in /src/mocks/yakkl-ui-private/ and provide safe fallbacks for public contributors. If you’re working on Pro-only features and need full access, contact the core team.

Removed this "bits-ui": "1.0.0-next.74", renamed .../components/ui, and commented out all bitsui references due to how it does not handle csp rules well
